# The-Red-River-Delta-data-project
This project aims to analyze the water quality of the Red River Delta region in Vietnam.

## Dataset 
The dataset used in this project consists of water quality measurements taken from various locations in the Red River Delta region over a period of 2 years (2018-2020).  The data includes information on various water quality parameters such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and chemical concentrations.

## Analysis
The goal of this project is to analyze the water quality data to identify any trends or patterns that may exist over time or across different locations in the Red River Delta region. This analysis will help to better understand the overall water quality in the region and identify any potential issues that may need to be addressed.
